This is a project I learned to make by following CodingWithVincent's tutorial.
It was originally scripted in python as the first interactive console program, then the logic was transferred into Javascript and made into an interactive webpage.
I added some of my own features to the tutorial version, including a "clear cart" button and local storage to save data on page refresh.
